# Walmart: SQL Challenge
Answering a bunch of problems and tasks using SQLite (IDE: DBeaver Application).

## Why?
- I wanted to receive a SQL Bootcamp certification but It required me to pass a SQL Challenge. I enrolled myself in multiple SQL bootcamps before and did one challenge which I failed (you need an 80%+). I enrolled again for another different challenge and passed it. 

## Languages and Technologies
- SQL (Specifically SQLite)
- IDE: DBeaver
